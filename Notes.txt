RandomForest Classifier
max features = sqrt
scan num trees from 1 to 200, minimum error happens somewhere around 
30-70, and flattens completely by 100. 
different random instances gives slightly different curves. 
So lets keep it safe at 100.

Feature engineering
SibSp and Parch show similar survival rates for the groupings of 
0,1-3 and >3
So make FamilySize and New Parch with these groups.

Age is very complicated. so age has be used in conjugation with gender/class
Males/Age 
0-10 have >50% survival, 
10-25  <10%
25-55 <20% survival, 
>55 ~0%
Females/Age 
0-9 have >50% survival, 
9-13 ~0%
13-50 ~80% survival, 
>50 ~100%
made a feature NewAge using these discrete groupings
##########got up to 0.79

Make separation of train and cv triggered by a random seed
loop over this 20 times to get random separations and train model on
each seperation, then majority vote for final prediction.
#####whoa!! jumped up to 0.81340, which is the score in the top 100.

Increased the number of loops to 100, 
score jumped to 0.81818, which is rank 52
